About me
---
I'm a third-year student of BrSTU (Brest State Technical University). My specialty is "Economics of electronic business" and it implies learning traditional economics and applying ICT for efficiency improvement. While studying I understood that sphere of programming appeals to me more and I want to deepen my knowledge in frontend development in particular. So now I'm eager to actively learn, acquire and improve new skills.

Code Example

You are going to rent a car on your vacation. Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total. Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

```
function rentalCarCost(d) {
  let totalSum = 40 * d;
  if (d >= 7) totalSum -= 50;
  else if (d >= 3) totalSum -= 20;
  return totalSum;
}
```
