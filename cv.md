About me
---
I'm a third-year student of BrSTU (Brest State Technical University). My specialty is "Economics of electronic business" and it implies learning traditional economics and applying ICT for efficiency improvement. While studying I understood that sphere of programming appeals to me more and I want to deepen my knowledge in frontend development in particular. So now I'm eager to actively learn, acquire and improve new skills.
